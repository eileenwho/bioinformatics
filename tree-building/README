for building concatenated protein trees
specific to our lab's workflow
this started out with me writing code so that we wouldn't have to manually run blast searches and copy sequences for every single genome file
code for running blastx searches loosely based off code that Cara Magnabosco wrote @ this point I've modified the structure pretty thoroughly tho
extractCopyProteinSeq at this point takes any amount of genome files and pulls out the sequences for specified ribosomal proteins (based on a reference database)
then copies them to existing files containing all the sequences for a given ribosomal protein from every species you've pulled sequences so far
these are the first steps for the workflow
